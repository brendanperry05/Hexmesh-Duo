Arcade shooter developed in Unity for the iOS App Store

It is an arcade shooter in which the player must control both sides of the board. Each block must be destroyed with a ball of the same color. Destroying the same color block multiple times in a row will give a boost to the score. Once the player has scored enough points, they can use their SUPER ability. This shoots balls that will destroy every block regardless of color for a few seconds.

There are 5 levels of increasing difficulty. There is an endless mode and a duel mode. Each level can be played with 2 people on the same screen.

I have uploaded the code to show my work so far, but I have excluded the rest of the Unity Project to protect my work as it is still unreleased.
